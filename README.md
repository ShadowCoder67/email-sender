# email-sender
Python program to send an email including subject, body, cancel send, and more features

You will need to provide the email adress you would like to send the email from as well as get the app password for the account you are using. Below are the instructions for doing so:

Create & use app passwords
Important: To create an app password, you need 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.

If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an app password.

Go to your Google Account.
Select Security
Under "Signing in to Google," select 2-Step Verification.
At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
Enter a name that helps you remember where youâ€™ll use the app password.
Select Generate.
To enter the app password, follow the instructions on your screen. The app password is the 16-character code that generates on your device.
Select Done.

Copy and paste this into the password section.

Enter body of email and choose whether or not to include an attachement. Future potential goals are to implement into a website with more functionality such as email tracking (fairly simple with specific libraries. should be complete within a day)

You can also choose whether or not to cancel the email.
